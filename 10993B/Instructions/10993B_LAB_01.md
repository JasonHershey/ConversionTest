# Module 1: Introducing Azure AD
# Lab: Creating and managing an Azure AD tenant
  
### Scenario
  
You are working as an administrator at Adatum Corporation. Your company wants to evaluate Azure AD services as part of their migration-to-cloud strategy. You decide to activate the trial Azure AD tenant and Office 365 subscription to evaluate the available options.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Activate the Azure AD tenant by using an Office 365 trial subscription.
-   Create an Azure AD tenant and objects in Azure AD.
-   Configure user roles in Azure AD.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated time: 45 minutes

Virtual machines:  **10993B-LON-CL1**, **10993B-LON-DC1**, and  **10993B-LON-DS1**

For  **LON-CL1**, use:
-   User name:  **Admin**
-   Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

For  **LON-DC1** and **LON-DS1**, use:
-   User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**
-   Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

Note the following for all tasks:
-   When you see references to  **_Adatumyyxxxx_.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **_Adatumyyxxxx_** with the unique domain name that you choose when you create a custom domain in Task 2 of Exercise 1, “Activate Office 365 trial subscriptions”.
-   Replace all instances of  **_yourdomain_** with your unique domain name that appears on the online lab portal.
-   Replace all instances of  **_hostdomain.com_** with the complete domain name of your lab-hosting provider.
-   When you see references to the account associated with your Azure AD trial subscription, you should use the account that you created in Task 2 of Exercise 1, “Activate Office 365 trial subscriptions”.


## Exercise 1: Activating Azure AD and Office 365 trial subscriptions
  
### Scenario
  
For this and later labs in this course, you should create a new Microsoft account. To support the use of additional services, and to provision the Azure AD tenant automatically, you must create an Office 365 E5 trial tenant. When creating Office365 E5 trial, you must create your global administrator account for all cloud services.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create a new Microsoft account
2.   Activate an Office 365 trial subscription


#### Task 1: Create a new Microsoft account

>  **Note:** We recommend that you have an active Microsoft account without an Azure subscription assigned to it. If you do not want to use your private Microsoft account, if you do not have one, or if you already have an Azure subscription, please follow the steps in this task to create a new Microsoft account.

1.   Sign in to  **LON-CL1** as **LON-CL1\Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.   Start Microsoft Edge, and then browse to  **www.live.com**.
3.   Click the  **Create** **free account** link, and then use the wizard to create a new Microsoft account. Choose your own password for this account.

  >  **Note:** Only for the purpose of this course, to avoid confusion, we recommend that you note or remember this password and use this same password for all cloud accounts that you create in the labs of this course. This password will be referred as _your password_ in all later tasks. All on-premises accounts from local AD DS, as well as the accounts that you synchronize from AD DS to Azure AD, will still use default password Pa55w.rd.

4.   Set up your time zone and theme colors.
5.   Verify that you can open the inbox for your Microsoft account.

>  **Note:** Make sure that you write down the user name that you chose. For example, you can choose a user name in the _YourInitials-Date_@outlook.com format, such as DJ-060815@outlook.com.


#### Task 2: Activate an Office 365 trial subscription
  
1.   In Microsoft Edge, go to https://aka.ms/AA31rhg, and then click **Free trial**.
2.   Select your country/region. If your country/region is not listed, select  **United States**.
3.   Enter the rest of your data in the fields. In the  **Business email address** box, enter the Microsoft account address that you created in Task 1. Type **Adatum** for the **Company name**, and then select  **250-999** people from the **Your organization size** drop-down box.
4.   Select a user name for your Microsoft Online ID, and then type  **_Adatumyyxxxxx_** in the **Yourcompany** field (for example, Adatum12332).
5.   Complete the phone verification.
6.   Save your Microsoft Online user ID data.
7.   Close Microsoft Edge.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully activated the trial versions of Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).


## Exercise 2: Configuring an Azure AD tenant and objects in Azure AD
  
### Scenario
  
After provisioning your Azure AD tenant, you must now enable additional functionalities and create user and group objects in Azure. Because you want to explore Azure AD with full functionality, you should activate Azure AD Premium and Enterprise Mobility Suite. Also, you want to add your custom domain to the Azure AD tenant, so you can later implement SSO. You will use both the Azure portal and Windows PowerShell to perform user management tasks.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Configure Azure AD tenant
2.   Add and verify a custom domain
3.   Create users and groups in the Azure portal
4.   Manage users and groups with Azure PowerShell


#### Task 1: Configure Azure AD tenant
  
1.   Navigate to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with the Office 365 account that you created in the previous exercise.
2.   In the navigation pane of the Azure portal, select the  **Azure Active Directory** item.
3.   Activate a trial license for Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 for your Azure AD tenant.
4.   Click  **Licenses** and ensure that Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 license are activated on your Azure AD tenant.


#### Task 2: Add and verify a custom domain
  
1.   Add a custom domain called  **yourdomain.hostdomain.com** to the **Adatum** Azure AD tenant.

  >  **Note:** **yourdomain** is the domain name assigned to you by the lab-hosting provider. If you are not sure about your domain name, ask your instructor.

2.   Identify the DNS records that you must create to verify the newly created domain. Use a TXT record to verify the domain.
3.   Configure the DNS domain in DNS Manager on  **LON-DC1**. You should configure the same new zone as the custom domain in Azure. Add  **TXTrecord** to the zone, as instructed in the Azure portal.
4.   Verify the domain in the Azure portal.
