To complete this lab successfully, you must have completed all lab tasks in Module 4.


## Exercise 1: Enabling and configuring Azure Information Protection
  
### Scenario
  Before you start protecting your document with Azure RMS, you must activate the Azure RMS service and configure templates.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Activate Azure Information Protection
2.  Configure Azure Information Protection labels


#### Task 1: Activate Azure Information Protection
  
1.  Open the Office 365 admin portal on  **LON-DS1**.
2.  Activate the Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 license for users Abbie Parsons and Adam Hobbs.
3.  Open the Azure portal on  **LON-DC1**.
4.  Add Azure Information Protection to the toolbar.
5.  Ensure that the Azure Information Protection service is activated.


#### Task 2: Configure Azure Information Protection labels
  
1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Information Protection.
2.  Open the properties window for the Global Policy.
3.  Add a new label and name it  **Adatum Documents Protection**. Provide a description and a color of your choice.
4.  Configure a new label to use protection so that all members from Adatum have the  **Viewer** right only.
5.  Configure automatic protection with a condition that detects the phrase  **Adatum-Internal** in the document.
6.  Use this label to configure a header for protected documents that reads:  **This document is protected to use only in Adatum Corp**.
7.  Add the label to the Global Policy.
8.  Configure Global Policy so that every document and email must have a label.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have enabled and configured Microsoft Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS).


## Exercise 2: Integrating Azure Information Protection with FCI
  
### Scenario
  You need to protect documents on your file server with appropriate Azure Information Protection labels. After you save documents on your file server in the appropriate folder, you must ensure that the  **A. Datum - Confidential** **View Only** template applies automatically to all documents in that folder.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Install the RMS connector
2.  Configure integration with Windows Server FCI
3.  Configure the FCI server for Azure RMS
4.  Configure the Azure RMS file management task


#### Task 1: Install the RMS connector
  
1.  Sign in to  **LON-SVR2** as **Adatum\\Administrator**.
2.  Open Internet Explorer and navigate to [https://aka.ms/AA31z7m](https://aka.ms/AA31z7m). 
3.  Download the Rights Management connector.
4.  Install the Rights Management connector on the computer.
5.  During the installation, authenticate by using the following credentials:

  - Username:  **msnider@adatumyyxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**
  - Password:  **Pa55w.rd!**

6.  Do not launch the RMS connector administration console upon completion.
7.  Copy the  **GenConnectorConfig.ps1** file to **\\LON-SVR1\C$**.


#### Task 2: Configure integration with Windows Server FCI
  
1.  On  **LON-SVR2**, double-click the  **Microsoft RMS connector administration tool** shortcut on the desktop.
2.  Sign in as  **msnider@adatumyyxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**.
3.  Add an FCI server ( **LON-SVR1**) to the allowed servers list.
4.  Click  **Close**.


#### Task 3: Configure the FCI server for Azure RMS
  
1.  Sign in to  **LON-SVR1** as **Adatum\\Administrator**.
2.  Open Windows PowerShell.
3.  At the Windows PowerShell prompt, navigate to  **C:\\**. Then run the  **.\GenConnectorConfig.ps1 -ConnectorUri http://lon-svr2.adatum.com -SetFCI2012** command.


#### Task 4: Configure the Azure RMS file management task
  
1.  On  **LON-SVR1**, make a new folder on drive  **C**. Name it  **Confidential**. Share the folder with  **Everyone** with the **Read/Write** permission.
2.  On  **LON-SVR1**, in  **Server** **Manager**, open  **File Server Resource Manager**.
3.  Create a new file management task named  **RMS task**.
4.  On the  **Scope** tab, select all the check boxes for the different file types, and then click **Add**.
5.  Browse to  **C:\\Confidential**, and then click  **OK**.
6.  On the  **Action** tab, click the **Type** drop-down list box, and then click **RMS Encryption**.
7.  Click the  **Confidential\\All Employees** template.
8.  On the  **Schedule** tab, select the **Saturday** check box, select the **Run continuously on new files** option, and then click **OK**.
9.  Switch to  **LON-CL2**, and then sign in as  **Adam@yourdomain.hostdomain.com**.
10.  Open Word 2016, type some text in a blank document, and then save it as  **Secret.docx** in the **\\\\LON-SVR1\\Confidential** folder.
11.  On  **LON-SVR1**, run the  **RMS task**, and wait for it to complete.
12.  Switch to  **LON-CL2**.
13.  Navigate to  **\\\\lon-svr1\\** **Confidential**.
14.  Open the  **Secret.docx** file and verify that it has been protected with the **Confidential\\All Employees** template.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have integrated Azure RMS with File Classification Infrastructure (FCI).


## Exercise 3: Using the Azure Information Protection client application on a client
