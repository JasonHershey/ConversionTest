# Module 3: Using Azure AD as a directory service in hybrid environments
# Lab: Using Azure AD in hybrid environments
  
### Scenario
  
You are working as an administrator at Adatum Corporation. You are evaluating Azure AD as an extension to your on-premises AD DS environment. You want to configure SSO between the local AD DS and Azure AD so that your local AD DS infrastructure provides authentication for both local and cloud-based resources. For better management of privileged accounts in Azure AD, you decide to implement Azure AD PIM. Additionally, you are considering joining a few Windows 10 computers to Azure AD.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
-   Join a Windows 10 computer to Azure AD.
-   Implement SSO with Azure AD.
-   Configure and use Azure AD PIM.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated time: 75 minutes

Virtual machines:  **10993B-LON-DC1**,  **10993B-LON-DS1**,  **10993B-LON-CL2**

## Exercise 2: Implementing SSO with Azure AD
  
### Scenario
  
After configuring directory synchronization between your local AD DS and Azure AD, you now want to centralize authentication for synchronized accounts. This will allow a user to use a single set of credentials when accessing both local and cloud resources. It will also mean that your local AD DS provides authentication.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Configure required Domain Name System (DNS) records
2.   Install and configure AD FS
3.   Install and configure Web Application Proxy
4.   Configure the domain for single sign-on (SSO)
5.   Test SSO
6.   Enable SSO for apps in the Azure gallery


#### Task 1: Configure required Domain Name System (DNS) records
  
1.   On  **LON-DS1**, open the Windows PowerShell command-line interface, and then run  **IPConfig**. Record the server IP address.
2.   On  **LON-DC1**, open  **DNS Manager**.
3.   In the  **_yourdomain_.hostdomain.com** zone, create a host record with a blank name by using the external IP address that the hosting partner provided.
4.   Create another host resource record with a blank name by using the IP address for  **LON-DS1** that you recorded in step 1.


#### Task 2: Install and configure AD FS
  
1.   Sign in to the  **LON-DS1** VM as **ADATUM\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.   Run the following command to create the Key Distribution Services root key to generate gMSA passwords for the account that this lab will use later:

  ```
  Add-KdsRootKey -EffectiveTime ((get-date).addhours(-10))
  ```

3.   Use  **Server Manager** to access the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** for installing the Active Directory Federation Services server role.
4.   After installation, in the  **Active Directory Federation Services Configuration Wizard**, configure the following settings:
  -   For the  **SSL Certificate**, use the wildcard certificate that the hosting provider supplied.
  -   For the  **Federation Service Name**, type  ** _yourdomain_.hostdomain.com**, replacing  **yourdomain** with your unique domain name.
  -   For the  **Federation Service Display Name**, type  **AdatumCorporation**.
  -   Create a gMSA named  **svc-ADFS**.
  -   Use  **Windows Internal Database** as the configuration database.

5.   Finish the configuration.
6.   Restart  **LON-DS1** and then sign in as Adatum\Administrator.


#### Task 3: Install and configure Web Application Proxy
  
1.   Sign in to the  **LON-WAP1** VM as **Adatum\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.   Use  **Server Manager** to access the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** for installing the **Web Application Proxy** role service from the Remote Access server role.
3.   Use Notepad to open the hosts file on  **LON-WAP1** located at **C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc**. At the end of the text in hosts file, start a new line and add the following text:    **10.0.0.11** ** _yourdomain_** **.hostdomain.com**
4.   On  **LON-WAP1**, use  **Remote Access Management** to open the **Web Application Proxy Configuration Wizard**.
5.   In the  **Web Application Proxy Configuration Wizard**, on the  **Welcome** page, click **Next**.
6.   On the  **Federation Server** page, use the following settings:
  -   Federation service name:  ** _yourdomain_.hostdomain.com**, replacing  _yourdomain_ with your unique domain name
  -   User name:  **Adatum\Administrator**
  -   Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

7.   Use the wildcard certificate that the hosting partner provided.
8.   Switch to the  **LON-DS1** VM.
9.   Verify that  **Event ID100** displays in **Event Viewer**.
10.   Switch to the  **LON-DC1** VM.
11.   In Internet Explorer, open the following URL, replacing  **yourdomain** with your unique domain name, to verify that the federation service is available: **https:// _yourdomain_.hostdomain.com/adfs/fs/federationserverservice.asmx**.
>  **Note:** The expected output is a display of XML with the service description document. If this page displays, then IIS on the federation server is operational and serving pages successfully.


#### Task 4: Configure the domain for single sign-on (SSO)
  
-   On  **LON-DS1**, run the following cmdlets in Windows PowerShell:

  ``` 
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -force
  $msolcred = Get-Credential

### Review question(s)

**Question** 
What was the purpose of the  **Convert-MsolDomainToFederated** cmdlet that you executed in the lab?

This cmdlet converts the domain that was configured in Azure AD to a federated domain. By doing this, you configure Azure AD to redirect authentication requests to your local AD FS and AD DS.

**Question** 
What is the purpose of the Web Application Proxy component when configuring SSO?

Authentication requests from Azure AD that come to your local AD DS proxy through Web Application Proxy to AD FS.
