# Lab Answer Key:  Module 3: Integrating with Azure virtual networks
# Lab: Implementing a point-to-site VPN by using Azure Resource Manager
  
## Exercise 1: Preparing a Microsoft Azure subscription for implementing a point-to-site VPN
  
#### Task 1: Create an Azure virtual network and configure its VPN prerequisites
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, click  **Start**, scroll down in the list of apps to the  **Windows PowerShell** folder, click the **Windows PowerShell** folder, and then right-click **Windows PowerShell** On the shortcut menu, click **More**, and then click  **Run as administrator**.
2.   If you receive a prompt from User Account Control, click  **Yes**.
3.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command and press Enter (replace &lt;subscription_name&gt; with the name of your subscription):
  ```
  $subscriptionName = '&lt;subscription_name&gt;'
  ```
4.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command and press Enter (replace &lt;Azure_region&gt; with the name of the Azure region provided by the instructor):
  ```
  $location = '&lt;Azure_region&gt;'
  ```
5.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
  ```
  D:\Mod03\Labfiles\New-10992P2SVPN.ps1
  ```

    >  **Note:** If prompted whether to enable data collection, type N and press Enter.

6.   When you receive a prompt to sign in, then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
7.   Wait until the script completes. This should take about a minute. Leave the  **Windows PowerShell** window open.


#### Task 2: Examine the Azure virtual network configuration
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, start Microsoft Internet Explorer, browse to  **http://portal.azure.com**, and if you receive a prompt to sign in, then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   In the  **Hub** vertical menu on the left, click **Resource groups**.
3.   In the  **Resource groups** blade, click **AdatumVNetRG**.
4.   In the  **AdatumVNetRG** blade, notice that the resource group contains a virtual network and a public IP address. The public IP address will be assigned to the VPN gateway after you provision it in the next exercise.
5.   Click  **AdatumVNet** in the **Essentials** section of the blade. This will automatically open the **AdatumVNet**.
6.   In the  **AdatumVNet** virtual network blade, click **Subnets**.
7.   In the  **Subnets** blade, notice that the virtual network contains two subnets provisioned by the Azure PowerShell script: **FrontEndSubnet** and **GatewaySubnet**.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully created an Azure Resource Manager virtual network by using Azure PowerShell. 


## Exercise 2: Completing the point-to-site VPN setup
  
#### Task 1: Generate the root and client certificates
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, in the  **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Set-Location 'D:\Mod03\Labfiles'
  ```
2.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  .\Makecert.exe -sky exchange -r -n "CN=AdatumRootCertificate" -pe -a sha1 -len 2048 -ss My "AdatumRootCertificate.cer"
  ```
3.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  .\makecert.exe -n "CN=AdatumClient1Certificate" -pe -sky exchange -m 96 -ss My -in "AdatumRootCertificate" -is my -a sha1
  ```
4.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
Get-ChildItem -Path '.\'
```
>  **Note:** Notice that the local folder contains the root certificate **AdatumRootCertificate.cer**.


#### Task 2: Configure the Azure VPN gateway root certificate
  
1.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  $rootCerText = Get-ChildItem -Path 'Cert:\CurrentUser\My' | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq 'CN=AdatumRootCertificate'}
  ```
2.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  $rootCertText = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($rootCerText.RawData)
  ```
3.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** console prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
$rootCert = New-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -Name AdatumRootCert -PublicCertData $rootCertText
```


#### Task 3: Create a point-to-site VPN gateway
  
1.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  .\Set-10992P2SVPN.ps1
  ```
2.   Wait until the provisioning of the gateway completes. This might take about 40 minutes.


#### Task 4: Export a client certificate to a .pfx file
  
1.   At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  certmgr.msc
  ```
2.   If you receive a prompt from User Account Control, click  **Yes**.
3.   In the Microsoft Management Console window, expand the  **Personal** node and click **Certificates**.
4.   Notice that the certificates with private keys for both  **AdatumRootCertificate** and **AdatumClient1Certificate** are located in the current user's **Personal** certificate store. Right-click **AdatumClient1Certificate**, and click  **All Tasks** in the right-click menu. Next, click **Export** in the **All Tasks** submenu. This will launch **Certificate Export Wizard.**
5.   On the  **Welcome to the Certificate Export Wizard** page, click **Next**.
6.   On the  **Export Private Key** page, select the **Yes, export the private key** option, and then click **Next**.
7.   On the  **Export File Format** page, accept the default options, and then click **Next**.
8.   On the  **Security** page, select the **Password** check box, type **Pa55w.rd** in both the **Password** and the **Confirm password** boxes, and then click **Next**
9.   On the  **File to Export** page, in the **File name** box, type **D:\Mod03\Labfiles\Client1Certificate.pfx**, and then click  **Next**.
10.   On the  **Completing the Certificate Export Wizard** page, click **Finish**.
11.   In the  **Certificate Export Wizard** dialog box, click **OK**.
12.   Switch to the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
Get-ChildItem -Path '.\'
```

Notice that the local folder now also contains the client certificate  **Client1Certificate.pfx**.
>  **Note:** In typical circumstances, you would now securely copy the client certificate to a client computer and import it into the **Personal** certificate store of the user of that computer. You can accomplish this task by using the Certificates snap-in of the Microsoft Management Console. This step is skipped here in the lab, because the lab computer already has this certificate installed.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully generated a test self-signed root and client certificate, configured an Azure VPN gateway root certificate, created a point-to-site VPN gateway, and tested the export of a client certificate.


## Exercise 3: Testing a point-to-site VPN from an on-premises virtual machine
  
#### Task 1: Download and install the VPN client configuration package
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, in the  **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press Enter:
