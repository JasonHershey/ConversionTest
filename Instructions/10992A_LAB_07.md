4.   On the  **Automation &amp; Control** page, keep the **Change Tracking** and **Update Management** checkboxes selected, and click **Configure Workspace**
5.   From the  **Automation Account** page, use the existing Automation account named **AdatumAutomation**.
6.   Leave the tab displaying the  **Microsoft Operations Management Suite** portal open.


#### Task 4: Create a runbook
  
1.   From the  **AdatumAutomation** Azure Automation account in the Azure portal, import the **D:\Mod07\Labfiles\New-10992Workflow.ps1** runbook as the **PowerShell Workflow**.
2.   Review the content of the workflow, and then publish the runbook.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully created an OMS workspace. You should have also added the Azure Automation &amp; Control solution to your workspace, created a new Azure Automation account and imported a sample Windows PowerShell Workflow-based runbook.


## Exercise 2: Configuring an on-premises computer as a Hybrid Runbook Worker
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you have configured all the Azure components that are necessary to perform your tests, it is time to configure your on-premises test computer. You will need to install the Microsoft Management Agent so that your test computer can communicate with OMS and the Automation account. You will also need to install the runbook environment and connect it to Azure Automation. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Install the Microsoft Management Agent on the lab virtual machine
2.   Install the runbook environment and connect to Azure Automation
