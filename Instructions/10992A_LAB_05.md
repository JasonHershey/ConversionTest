## Exercise 1: Preparing your Microsoft Azure subscription for implementing Site Recovery
  
### Scenario
  
Before you configure your first test Site Recovery environment, you must create an Azure virtual network, an Azure storage account, and a Recovery Services vault in your Azure subscription. In addition, you will configure the Recovery Services vault protection goal, which defines the scenario you intend to implement, with Hyper-V hosts on-premises and in the secondary site in Azure. These are Azure-based prerequisites that must be in place before you can configure protection of your Hyper-V virtual machines.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure virtual network
2.   Create an Azure storage account
3.   Create a Recovery Services vault
4.   Configure the Recovery Services vault protection goals


#### Task 1: Create an Azure virtual network
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, start  **Internet Explorer**, browse to the Azure portal, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure portal, create a new Azure virtual network with the following settings:
  -   Name:  **AdatumASRVNet**

  -   Address space:  **192.168.0.0/16**

  -   Subnet name:  **Subnet1**

  -   Subnet address range:  **192.168.0.0/24**

## Exercise 3: Configuring Site Recovery protection of a Hyper-V virtual machine
  
### Scenario
  
After you have satisfied all the prerequisites, you can configure protection of your Hyper-V virtual machine. To accomplish this, you will first verify that the Azure virtual network and the Azure storage account you created in the first exercise of this lab qualify to host the replica of your protected virtual machine. Next, you will create a Site Recovery replication policy in the Recovery Services vault and associate it with your Hyper-V host. This will finally allow you to configure and enable replication of the Hyper-V virtual machine. With the protected virtual machine in place, you can then create a recovery plan. 

Finally, to minimize the cost of your testing, you will identify and delete all the Azure resources that you created in your test environment.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Verify the existence of a Site Recovery target storage account and virtual network 
2.   Create and associate a Site Recovery replication policy with the Hyper-V host
