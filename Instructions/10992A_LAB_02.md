## Exercise 1: Preparing for an upload of a virtual disk file to Azure
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum Corporation configures its Hyper-V virtual disk files in the .vhdx format. You realize that Azure requires that its virtual machine disk files are in the .vhd format. You plan to first create a sample fixed .vhdx file and test converting it to the .vhd format. Next, you will create an Azure storage account where the virtual disk file will reside after the upload. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure storage account
2.   Create a .vhdx virtual disk
3.   Convert the .vhdx virtual disk to the .vhd format


#### Task 1: Create an Azure storage account
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, browse to the Azure portal, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure portal, create a new storage account with the following settings:

  -   Name: a unique name from 3 through 24 characters that includes lowercase letters and digits.

  -   Deployment model:  **Resource Manager**

  -   Account kind:  **General purpose**

  -   Performance:  **Standard**

  -   Replication:  **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

  -   Storage service encryption:  **Disabled**

  -   Subscription: the name of your Azure subscription

  -   Resource group: a new resource group named  **UploadedVHDRG**

  -   Location: An Azure region close to the location of your lab VM

  -   Pin to dashboard: leave cleared


3.   Do not wait until the storage account is created, but proceed to the next task.


#### Task 2: Create a .vhdx virtual disk
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Computer Management.
2.   In the  **Computer Management** console, click **Disk Management**.
3.   From the  **Disk Management** snap-in of the **Computer Management** console, create a new virtual disk with the following settings:

  -   Location:  **D:\Mod02\Labfiles\LabDisk.vhdx**

  -   Virtual hard disk size:  **1** **GB**

  -   Virtual hard disk format:  **VHDX**

  -   Virtual hard disk type:  **Fixed size**


4.   Detach the newly created disk.
5.   Close  **Computer Management**.


#### Task 3: Convert the .vhdx virtual disk to the .vhd format
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
2.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following cmdlet,

  ```
  Convert-VHD -Path D:\Mod02\Labfiles\LabDisk.vhdx -DestinationPath D:\Mod02\Labfiles\LabDisk.vhd
  ```

3.   Wait until the conversion completes. This should take a few seconds

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully created an Azure storage account, created a fixed .vhdx virtual disk file, and converted it to the .vhd format.


## Exercise 2: Uploading a virtual disk file to Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you converted the virtual disk file to the .vhd format and created an Azure storage account, you are ready to upload the .vhd file. You will accomplish this by using the AzCopy.exe utility.

A. Datum Corporation wants to minimize the cost associated with testing Azure capabilities. You need to identify and delete all the resources you deploy during your tests.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Upload the .vhd file to the Azure storage account
2.   Identify and delete all the Azure resources used in the lab


#### Task 1: Upload the .vhd file to the Azure storage account
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, switch to the Internet Explorer window showing the Azure portal and navigate to the storage account you created in the first exercise of this lab.
2.   Copy the value of key1 of the storage account to Clipboard.
3.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, sign in to the Azure subscription by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
    >  **Note:** If prompted whether to enable data collection, type N and press Enter.

4.   If you have multiple subscriptions, then at the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following cmdlet (where _Your_Azure_subscription_name_ designates the name of your Azure subscription).

  ```
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName 'Your_Azure_subscription_name'
  ```
5.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell**, run the following cmdlet.

  ```
  $storageAccount = Get-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName 'UploadedVHDRG'
  ```
6.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, change the current directory to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy**.
7.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following cmdlet.

  ```
  .\AzCopy.exe /Source:"D:\Mod02\Labfiles" /Dest:"https://$($storageAccount.StorageAccountName).blob.core.windows.net/vhds" /DestKey:storage_account_key /BlobType:page /Pattern:"LabDisk.vhd" /Y
  ```
>  **Note:** Because AzCopy copies only the content of the VHD file that is in use, the upload should take a few seconds.


#### Task 2: Identify and delete all the Azure resources used in the lab
  
1.   From the Azure portal, delete the  **UploadedVHDRG** resource group.
2.   Close all open windows.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully uploaded the .vhd file to an Azure storage account. After the upload completes, you should have identified and removed all of the Azure resources that you created for this lab by using the Azure portal.



## 
  
**Question** 
What type of conversion is necessary prior to uploading virtual disk files to an Azure storage account?

**Question** 
What would be your primary considerations when downloading virtual disk files from Azure to your on-premises computers?

## Exercise 1: Creating a Docker host by using Docker Machine
  
### Scenario
  
To test the planned deployment, you must identify the tool that will allow you to deploy Docker hosts to both Azure virtual machines and on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines. You decide to evaluate the Docker Toolbox for Windows. After you deploy the two Docker host virtual machines, you intend to use Docker Machine, included in the Docker Toolbox, to verify that they are both operational. To accomplish this, you want to install and run a sample containerized web server named nginx, which is available from GitHub, on each one.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Install Docker Toolbox for Windows
2.   Create a Docker host in a Hyper-V virtual machine by using Docker Machine 
3.   Create a Docker host in an Azure virtual machine by using Docker Machine
4.   Run a container in a Docker host running in a Hyper-V virtual machine
5.   Run a container in a Docker host running in an Azure virtual machine


#### Task 1: Install Docker Toolbox for Windows
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, start the installation of Docker Toolbox for Windows from  **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox**. 
2.   During the installation process, clear the  **Help Docker improve Toolbox** checkbox and exclude **Kinematic for Windows (Alpha)** from the list of components to install.
3.   When asked by the  **Windows Security** dialog box whether to install a software device, click **Don't Install**, and then complete the installation.

  ```
  @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker-machine env azuredockervm') DO @%i
  ```


#### Task 4: Run a container in a Docker host running in a Hyper-V virtual machine
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, from Server Manager, start Hyper-V Manager. 
2.   In the  **Hyper-V** **Manager** window, connect to the console of **localdockervm**. 
3.   At the command prompt in the console of the  **localdockervm**, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker run -d -p 80:80 --restart=always nginx
  ```

  Wait until the container for nginx is downloaded and started on the Docker host virtual machine. This might take a few minutes depending on the available bandwidth.

4.   To obtain the IP address of the target Docker virtual machine hosting the containerized application, run the following command at the command prompt on  **localdockervm**.

  ```
  ifconfig eth0
  ```

  Look at the second line of the output, and note the IP address following the  **inet addr:** string.

5.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, and then browse to the IP address you obtained in the previous step. Verify that Internet Explorer displays the  **Welcome to nginx** page.
  
  >  **Note:** The ability to connect to nginx depends on the availability of DHCP in the lab environment.


#### Task 5: Run a container in a Docker host running in an Azure virtual machine

  ```

4.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, and then browse to the IP address you obtained in the previous step. Verify that Internet Explorer displays the  **Welcome to nginx** page.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully installed Docker Toolbox for Windows, created a Docker host in a Hyper-V virtual machine by using Docker Machine, created a Docker host in an Azure virtual machine by using Docker Machine, and run a sample containerized web server nginx on both Docker host virtual machines.


## Exercise 2: Deploying a private Docker Registry in Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you have successfully implemented a Docker host in an on-premises Hyper-V virtual machine and in an Azure virtual machine, you want to test the setup and image deployment by using a private Docker Registry in Azure. To simplify your tests, you will use a small, sample hello-world image available from the Docker Hub Registry. You will start by creating a private registry hosted in an Azure storage account. You will then download the sample image to your lab computer and upload it to the newly created private registry. Finally, you will deploy the image from the private registry to both the Azure and the on-premises Docker hosts.

Because A. Datum Corporation wants to minimize the cost associated with testing Azure capabilities, you will identify and delete all the resources you deploy during your tests.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure storage account
2.   Deploy a private Docker Registry
3.   Upload an image to the private Docker Registry
4.   Download and deploy images from the private Docker Registry
5.   Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
6.   Prepare for the next lab


#### Task 1: Create an Azure storage account
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, browse to the Azure portal, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription. 
2.   From the Azure portal, create a new storage account with the following settings:
  -   Name: a unique name from 3 through 24 characters that includes lowercase letters and digits

  -   Deployment model:  **Resource Manager**

  -   Account kind:  **General purpose**

  -   Performance:  **Standard**

  -   Replication:  **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

  -   Storage service encryption:  **Disabled**

3.   Wait until the storage account is created before you proceed to the next exercise. This should take about one minute.


#### Task 2: Deploy a private Docker Registry
  
1.   In the Azure portal, add the new inbound security rule to the  **azuredockervm-firewall** in the **docker-machine** network security group with the following settings:
  -   Name:  **RegistryAllowAny**

  -   Priority: accept the default value

  -   Source:  **Any**

  -   Service:  **Custom**

  -   Protocol:  **Any**

  -   Port range:  **5000**

  -   Action:  **Allow**

2.   In the Azure portal, navigate to the newly created storage account.
3.   Identify the storage account name and the value of key1.
4.   On  **MIA-CL1**, at the command prompt, run the following command. Replace the  _storage-account-name_ with the name of the storage account and replace the _storage-account-key_ with the value of key1.

  ```
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -e REGISTRY_STORAGE=azure -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTNAME="storage-account-name" -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY="storage-account-key" -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_CONTAINER="registry" 
--name=registry registry:2
  ```

5.   Wait for the new registry container to be provisioned. 
6.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker ps
  ```

7.   Verify that the output includes the newly created registry. 


#### Task 3: Upload an image to the private Docker Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, at the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker pull hello-world:latest
  ```

  This pulls the most recent image of the hello-world container image from the Docker Hub.

2.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker tag hello-world localhost:5000/hello-world
  ```

  This tags the image and designates its repository to be the newly created registry.

3.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker push localhost:5000/hello-world
  ```

  This pushes the image into the registry. 

4.   Switch to the Internet Explorer session showing the Azure portal.

#### Task 4: Download and deploy images from the private Docker Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, at the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker pull localhost:5000/hello-world
  ```

  This pulls the most recent image of the hello-world container image from the private Docker Registry.

2.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker run -d --restart=always hello-world
  ```

  This deploys the image downloaded from the private Docker Registry and runs it continuously.

3.   To verify that the image has been successfully deployed, at the command prompt, run the following command.

  ```
  docker ps
  ```

  Note that the output includes the hello-world image.


#### Task 5: Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
  
1.   From the Azure portal, delete the  **DockerRegistryRG** resource group.
2.   From the Azure portal, delete the  **docker-machine** resource group
3.   Close all open windows.
