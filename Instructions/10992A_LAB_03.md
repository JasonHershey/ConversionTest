# Module 3: Integrating with Azure virtual networks
# Lab: Implementing a point-to-site VPN by using Azure Resource Manager
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum wishes to implement hybrid networking between an Azure virtual network and its on-premises computers. While the longer-term plan is to set up either a site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute, at this point you have been asked to test the direct network connectivity between the two environments by implementing a point-to-site VPN from a virtual machine running on one of your Hyper-V hosts.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Generate a self-signed root certificate and client certificates for authenticating and encrypting a point-to-site VPN tunnel.
-   Create an Azure virtual network and prepare it for a point-to-site VPN by using Azure Resource Manager.
-   Create an Azure virtual machine by using the Azure PowerShell following both the classic and the Azure Resource Manager deployment models.
-   Create and deploy an Azure Resource Manager template that provisions an Azure virtual machine.

## Exercise 1: Preparing a Microsoft Azure subscription for implementing a point-to-site VPN
  
### Scenario
  
To prepare for setting up a test point-to-site VPN environment, you must first create a virtual network in Azure and configure networking prerequisites, including the gateway subnet and the public IP address for the VPN gateway.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure virtual network and configure its VPN prerequisites
2.   Examine the Azure virtual network configuration


#### Task 1: Create an Azure virtual network and configure its VPN prerequisites
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, start  **Windows PowerShell** as administrator.
2.   From the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, run the following (replace &lt;subscription_name&gt; with the name of your subscription):
  ```
  $subscriptionName = '&lt;subscription_name&gt;'
  ```
3.   From the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, run the following (replace &lt;Azure_region&gt; with the name of the Azure region provided by the instructor): :
  ```
  $location = '&lt;Azure_region&gt;'
  ```
4.   From the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, run the following:
  ```
  D:\Mod03\Labfiles\New-10992P2SVPN.ps1
  ```

    >  **Note:** If prompted whether to enable data collection, type N and press Enter.

5.   When you receive a prompt to sign in, then, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
6.   Wait until the script completes. This should take about a minute. Leave the  **Windows PowerShell** window open.


#### Task 2: Examine the Azure virtual network configuration
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, start Microsoft Internet Explorer, browse to the Azure portal, and if you receive a prompt, then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   In the Azure portal, navigate to the  **AdatumVNetRG** resource group blade. Notice that the resource group contains a virtual network and a public IP address. The public IP address will be assigned to the VPN gateway after you provision it in the next exercise.
3.   Navigate to the  **Subnets** blade of the **AdatumVNet** virtual network. Notice that the virtual network contains two subnets provisioned by the Azure PowerShell script: **FrontEndSubnet** and **GatewaySubnet**.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully created an Azure Resource Manager virtual network by using Azure PowerShell. 


## Exercise 2: Completing the point-to-site VPN setup
  
### Scenario
  
With Azure prerequisites for your point-to-site VPN test, now you need to complete the remaining components of the point-to-site VPN test environment. These include a test self-signed root and client certificates, the Azure VPN gateway root certificate, and a point-to-site VPN gateway. You also need to test the process of exporting a client certificate. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Generate the root and client certificates
2.   Configure the Azure VPN gateway root certificate
3.   Create a point-to-site VPN gateway
4.   Export a client certificate to a .pfx file


#### Task 1: Generate the root and client certificates
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, in the  **Windows PowerShell** window, change the current directory to **D:\** **Mod03\Labfiles**.
2.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following command:
  ```
  .\Makecert.exe -sky exchange -r -n "CN=AdatumRootCertificate" -pe -a sha1 -len 2048 -ss My "AdatumRootCertificate.cer"
  ```
3.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following command:
  ```
  .\makecert.exe -n "CN=AdatumClient1Certificate" -pe -sky exchange -m 96 -ss My -in "AdatumRootCertificate" -is my -a sha1
  ```
4.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** window, list files in the current directory. Notice that the local folder contains the root certificate **AdatumRootCertificate.cer**.


#### Task 2: Configure the Azure VPN gateway root certificate
  
1.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following:
  ```
  $rootCerText = Get-ChildItem -Path 'Cert:\CurrentUser\My' | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq 'CN=AdatumRootCertificate'}
  ```
2.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following:
  ```
  $rootCertText = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($rootCerText.RawData)
  ```
3.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following:

```
$rootCert = New-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -Name AdatumRootCert -PublicCertData $rootCertText
```


#### Task 3: Create a point-to-site VPN gateway
  
1.   From the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following:
  ```
  .\Set-10992P2SVPN.ps1
  ```
2.   Wait until the provisioning of the gateway completes. This might take about 40 minutes.


#### Task 4: Export a client certificate to a .pfx file
  
1.   Open the Microsoft Management Console Certificates snap-in showing the current user account certificate store.
2.   In the Microsoft Management Console window, navigate to the  **Personal Certificates** store of the current user.
3.   Notice that the certificates with private keys for both  **AdatumRootCertificate** and **AdatumClient1Certificate** are located in the current user's **Personal** certificate store. Start the **Certificate Export Wizard** for the **AdatumClient1Certificate**.
4.   Ensure that the private key is included in the certificate. Accept the default format options. Protect the certificate with the password set to  **Pa55w.rd**.
5.   Export the certificate to the  **D:\** **Mod03\Labfiles\Client1Certificate.pfx** file.
6.   In the  **Windows PowerShell** console, list files in the current directory. Notice that the local folder now also contains the client certificate **Client1Certificate.pfx**.
>  **Note:** In typical circumstances, you would now securely copy the client certificate to a client computer and import it into the **Personal** certificate store of the user of that computer. You can accomplish this task by using the Certificates snap-in of the Microsoft Management Console. This step is skipped here in the lab, because the lab computer already has this certificate installed.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully generated a test self-signed root and client certificate, configured an Azure VPN gateway root certificate, created a point-to-site VPN gateway, and tested the export of a client certificate.


## Exercise 3: Testing a point-to-site VPN from an on-premises virtual machine
  
### Scenario
  
You have completed the test deployment of the point-to-site VPN components. Now you need to test connecting from your test computer to the Azure virtual network by using a point-to-site VPN.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Download and install the VPN client configuration package
2.   Establish a point-to-site VPN from the on-premises virtual machine
3.   Identify and delete all lab Azure Resource Manager resources


#### Task 1: Download and install the VPN client configuration package
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, from the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmVpnClientPackage -ResourceGroupName 'AdatumVNetRG' -VirtualNetworkGatewayName AdatumVGateway -ProcessorArchitecture Amd64
  ```
2.   Copy the URL returned by the cmdlet into Notepad, and then remove the leading and trailing double quotation marks.
