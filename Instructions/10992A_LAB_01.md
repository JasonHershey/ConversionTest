  -   Name:  **armvm3RG**

  -   Location:  **D:\Mod01\Labfiles**

  -   Solution:  **Create new solution**

  -   Solution name:  **armvm3RG**

  -   The  **Create directory for solution** checkbox: enabled

2.   Use the  **Windows Virtual Machine** Azure template to populate the project.
3.   View the content of the  **WindowsVirtualMachine.json** file and its **JSON Outline**.
4.   In the  **JSON Outline** window, review the list of parameters and resources.
    >  **Note:** Resources include a storage account, a public IP address, a virtual network, a network interface, and a VM. In addition, the **VirtualMachine** entry contains the **AzureDiagnostics** VM extension.


#### Task 2: Deploy an Azure Resource Manager template from Visual Studio
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, in the Visual Studio interface, in the Solution Explorer window, initiate the build of the project.
2.   From the Solution Explorer window, initiate a new deployment.
3.   From the  **Deploy to Resource Group** dialog box, sign in to your Azure subscription with the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
4.   Edit parameters of the template deployment by using the following settings:
  -   adminUsername:  **Student**

  -   adminPassword:  **Pa55w.rd1234**

  -   dnsNameForPublicIP: type a unique name that will be assigned to the public IP address of the VM

  -   windowsOSVersion:  **2012-R2-Datacenter**

  -   The  **Save passwords as plain text in the parameters file** check box: enabled

5.   From the  **Deploy to Resource Group** dialog box, create a new resource group named **armvm3RG** in the Azure region closest to the classroom location.
6.   Start the deployment.
7.   Monitor the progress of deployment by viewing entries in the  **Output** window.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully created and deployed an Azure Resource Manager template that provisions a new Azure VM by using Visual Studio.


## Exercise 4: Identify and delete newly deployed resources
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum wants to minimize cost associated with testing Azure capabilities. You need to identify and delete all of the resources that you deployed during your tests.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Identify and delete all lab Azure Resource Manager resources
2.   Identify and delete all lab classic resources


#### Task 1: Identify and delete all lab Azure Resource Manager resources
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, start Internet Explorer.
2.   Browse to the Azure portal, and when prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
3.   In the Azure portal, navigate to the  **Resource groups** blade, and then delete the **armvm1RG**,  **armvm2RG**, and  **armvm3RG** resource groups.
    >  **Note:** The resource group contains, in addition to the VMs, all of their resources, including network interfaces, network security groups, public IP addresses, virtual networks, and storage accounts.


#### Task 2: Identify and delete all lab classic resources
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure portal, navigate to the  **Resource Groups** blade.
2.   From the  **Resource Groups** blade, delete the **classicvm1RG** resource group.
    >  **Note:** In addition to the **classicvm1** VM, the resource group contains all of its associated resources, including the cloud service, virtual network, and storage account.

3.   From the  **Resource groups** blade, delete the resource group whose name starts with the **classicvm2svc** prefix.
    >  **Note:** This is the resource group corresponds to the cloud service that you provisioned in Task 2 of Exercise.


    >  **Note:** The resource group contains the VM and the corresponding cloud service. There is no virtual network, since the script did not deploy the VM into a virtual network. The storage account resides in a separate resource group.

4.   From the  **Resource groups** blade, delete the resource group whose name starts with the **Default-Storage** prefix, followed by the name of the region to which you deployed the VM in Task 1 of Exercise 2.
    >  **Note:** The resource group contains the classic storage account. Due to dependencies of virtual machines on the storage account residing in the Default-Storage resource group, ensure that other resource groups have been successfully deleted before proceeding with step 8.

5.   Close all open windows

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have used the Azure portal to successfully remove the classic VMs and Azure Resource Manager VMs that you created, and all of their associated resources.
