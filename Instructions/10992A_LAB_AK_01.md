    >  **Note:** Notice that in addition to the **armvm1** VM, the resource group contains all of its resources, including the network interface, network security group, public IP address, virtual network, and storage account.

7.   In the  **Are you sure you want to delete "armvm1RG"?** blade, in the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** text box, type in the name of the resource group, and then click **Delete**.
8.   Scroll to the left to the  **Resource groups** blade.
9.   Repeat the steps 5 to 8 for the  **armvm2RG** and **armvm3RG** resource groups.


#### Task 2: Identify and delete all lab classic resources
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure portal, in the  **Hub** vertical menu on the left, click **Resource Groups**.
2.   In the  **Resource groups** blade, click **classicvm1RG**. 
3.   In the  **classicvm1RG** blade, click **Delete**.
    >  **Note:** Notice that in addition to the **classicvm1** VM, the resource group contains all of its associated resources, including the cloud service, virtual network, and storage account.

4.   In the  **Are you sure you want to delete "classicvm1RG"?** blade, in the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** text box, type in the name of the resource group, and then click **Delete**.
5.   Scroll to the left to the  **Resource groups** blade, and then click the resource group whose name starts with the **classicvm2svc** prefix.
    >  **Note:** This is the resource group corresponding to the cloud service that you provisioned in Task 2 of Exercise 2.

6.   In the  **Resource groups** blade, click **Delete**.
    >  **Note:** The resource group contains the VM and the corresponding cloud service. There is no virtual network, since the script did not deploy the VM into a virtual network. The storage account resides in a separate resource group.

7.   In the resulting blade, in the  **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** text box, type in the name of the resource group, and then click **Delete**.
8.   Scroll to the left to the  **Resource groups** blade, and then click the resource group whose name starts with the **Default-Storage** prefix, followed by the name of the region to which you deployed the VM in task 1 of exercise 2.
    >  **Note:** This resource group contains the classic storage account. Due to dependencies of virtual machines on the storage account residing in the Default-Storage resource group, ensure that other resource groups have been successfully deleted before proceeding with step 9.

9.   In the blade of the resource group, click  **Delete**.
10.   In the resulting blade, in the  **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** text box, type in the name of the resource group, and then click **Delete**.
11.   Close all open windows.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have used the Azure portal to successfully remove the classic VMs and Azure Resource Manager VMs that you created, and all of their associated resources.
