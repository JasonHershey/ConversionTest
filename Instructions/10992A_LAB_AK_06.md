## Exercise 3: Testing Traffic Manager failover functionality
  
#### Task 1: Test Traffic Manager routing to the web app
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, click  **Start**, type  **cmd**, right-click  **Command Prompt, and then** **click** **Run as administrator**. 
2.   In the  **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  nslookup &lt;traffic_manager_profile&gt;.trafficmanager.net
  ```

  where  _&lt;traffic_manager_profile&gt;_ represents the unique name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile.

3.   Notice the output of the command. The  **Name** entry should contain the name assigned to the public IP of the network interface attached to the virtual machine.
    >  **Note:** This is the expected outcome, because you chose the **Performance** routing method of the Traffic Manager profile. According to the lab setup, the Azure virtual machine resides in the Azure region closer to you, as would be the case if this virtual machine was representing your on-premises web server.

4.   Switch to the Azure portal that shows the  **Traffic** **Manager profile** blade.
5.   In the blade, click  **Overview**. 
6.   Under the  **DNS name** entry that contains the name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile, click the link. This should automatically open the Internet Explorer window that displays the Adatum web app home page of the Adatum Web site running in the virtual machine.


#### Task 2: Shut down the virtual machine and test Traffic Manager routing
  
1.   Switch to the Azure portal. In the hub menu, click  **Virtual machines**.
2.   In the  **Virtual machines** blade, click **TMLabVM**. 
3.   In the  **TMLabVM** blade, click **Stop**.
4.   When you receive the prompt to stop  **'TMLabVM'**, click  **Yes.** Wait for the notification that the virtual machine is stopped.
5.   Switch back to the browser window that shows the Adatum web app home page, and then click  **Contact**. The connection should time out, because, with the current settings, it takes more than a minute for the failover to take effect. 
6.   Switch to the  **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, re-type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  nslookup &lt;traffic_manager_profile&gt;.trafficmanager.net
  ```

  where  _&lt;traffic_manager_profile&gt;_ represents the unique name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile.

7.   Take a note of the output of the command. At this point, the  **Name** entry should represent the name assigned to the Azure web app.
8.   Switch to Internet Explorer. Click the cogwheel icon in the upper right corner. In the drop down menu, click  **Safety**, and then in the next menu, click  **InPrivate Browsing**.
9.   In the URL box, type  **http:// _&lt;traffic_manager_profile&gt;._trafficmanager.net** where _&lt;traffic_manager_profile&gt;_ represents the unique name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile. Press Enter.
10.   Notice that you can successfully access the Adatum web app home page again. Traffic Manager automatically redirected you to the Azure web app instance.
  >  **Note:** The Traffic Manager profile facilitates automatic failover regardless of the routing method.


#### Task 3: Identify and delete all lab Azure Resource Manager resources.
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, switch to the Azure portal. 
2.   In the hub vertical menu on the left, click  **Resource Groups**.
3.   In the  **Resource groups** blade, click **TMLabRG**. 
4.   In the  **TMLabRG** blade, click **Delete**. 
5.   In the  **Are you sure you want to delete "TMLabRG"?** blade, type the name of the resource group in the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** box, and then click **Delete**.
6.   Close Internet Explorer.


#### Task 4: Prepare for the next lab
  
After you have completed this lab, revert the virtual machines in preparation for the next lab: 

1.   On the host computer, start Microsoft Hyper-V Manager.
2.   In the Virtual Machines list, right-click  **10992A-MIA-CL1**, and then click  **Revert**.
3.   In the  **Revert Virtual Machine** dialog box, click **Revert**.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully tested the normal operations of Traffic Manager configured with the performance routing method. You should also have successfully verified that Traffic Manager can detect the failure of one of its endpoints and automatically redirect traffic to the remaining one by altering the outcome of the DNS name resolution process.
