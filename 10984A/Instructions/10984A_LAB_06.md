# Module 6: SharePoint and OneDrive for Business hybrid deployment
# Lab: Implement SharePoint and OneDrive for Business in a hybrid configuration
  
### Scenario
You are the SharePoint administrator for a company called Adatum Corporation. Your company has run SharePoint Server on-premises to provide an intranet for cross-team communications and collaboration, along with on-premises personal file storage with OneDrive for Business. Adatum is considering moving to SharePoint Online so that they can better use the financial and feature benefits of Office 365. The company would like to evaluate the user experience and capabilities of SharePoint Online before committing to a full move to SharePoint Online.

Adatum has decided to implement a hybrid configuration of SharePoint Online with their existing on-premises SharePoint Server 2016 deployment as a pilot project. You oversee planning and deploying the hybrid SharePoint infrastructure. As part of this pilot project, you will deploy hybrid sites, hybrid OneDrive for Business, and cloud hybrid search.

### Objectives
After completing the lab, you will be able to:

- Design and prepare a SharePoint Server for a hybrid configuration.
- Deploy SharePoint sites in a hybrid configuration.
- Validate the SharePoint services functionality in a hybrid configuration.

> **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Office 365. Microsoft Worldwide Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
Estimated time: 70 minutes

Virtual machines: **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-SP1**, **10984A-LON-CL1**, and **10984A-LON-CL2**

Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**, **Adatum\\Beth**, and **Adatum\\Allan**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

This lab requires the following virtual machines:

- **10984A-LON-DC1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password**Pa55w.rd**.

- **10984A-LON-SP1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password**Pa55w.rd**.

- **10984A-LON-CL1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Beth** using the password**Pa55w.rd**.

- **10984-LON-CL2**
  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Allan** using the password**Pa55w.rd**.

> **Note:** It can take a long time for the cloud search service results to appear in SharePoint Online. When validating hybrid site functionality, especially hybrid cloud search, you may need to wait several hours.


## Exercise 1: Design and prepare SharePoint Server for a hybrid configuration
  
### Scenario
Before deploying hybrid SharePoint, you need to design the solution, verify prerequisites, and perform preparation steps on your SharePoint Server and your Office 365 tenant. For your pilot project, you will use the **10984A-LON-SP1** on-premises single-server SharePoint Server farm, which hosts the IT department's SharePoint team site, My Sites and OneDrive. You also have an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription. The subscription is activated, your custom domain has been added to Office 365, and user account federation has been configured.


The following services should be configured in the SharePoint Server farm, but you must verify that they are configured correctly:

- Managed Metadata
- My Site
- User Profiles

As part of your pilot, you will configure the hybrid SharePoint solution to work with these services. You will also make it possible for the IT department users to view search results that include both on-premises and cloud-based content when they search from SharePoint Online. The IT department users are all hybrid users with both local and Office 365 accounts. You do not want to add devices or make other changes to your network at this time. For the purposes of the pilot, you will not configure hybrid content types or taxonomy term groups.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Design a hybrid solution
2.  Verify prerequisites for hybrid scenario
3.  Prepare on-premises and cloud infrastructure for hybrid scenario


#### Task 1: Design a hybrid solution

1.  Read the exercise scenario.
2.  Using the information provided in the earlier planning topics, answer the following questions:

  - What hybrid search configuration is required to support the pilot scenario?
  - What Office 365 or SharePoint Online subscriptions will not support the pilot scenario?
  - What SharePoint hybrid feature set supports the pilot scenario?
  - What SharePoint Server 2016 version is supported by the pilot scenario?
  - What services need to be configured in the on-premises SharePoint Server farm?


#### Task 2: Verify prerequisites for hybrid scenario
  
- Review the earlier topics, identify the prerequisites for each scenario, and answer the following questions:

  - What prerequisites do hybrid sites have?
  - What prerequisites does hybrid OneDrive for Business have?
  - What prerequisites does hybrid cloud search have?
  - How can you verify the configuration of Managed Metadata, My Site, and Users Profile services in SharePoint Server?


#### Task 3: Prepare on-premises and cloud infrastructure for hybrid scenario

**Install online service management tools**

1.  On **LON-SP1**, sign in by using the following credentials:

  - Username: **Administrator**
  - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
  - Domain: **Adatum**

2.  Download and install the **Microsoft Online Sign-in Assistant** from **https://aka.ms/AA216y6**.

3.  Download and install the **SharePoint Online management Shell** from **https://aka.ms/AA21ej5**.

4.  Restart LON-SP1 and sign in.

5.  Open Windows PowerShell ISE as an administrator and run the following commands to download the **MSOnline PowerShell for Azure Active Directory** module and import all of the tools into Windows PowerShell:

  ```
  Install-Module -Name MSOnline
  Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell
  Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
  Import-Module MSOnline -force
  ```

> **Note:** If prompted to install a Nu Get package, confirm the installation, including confirming installation from an untrusted source.

**Configure server-to-server authentication**

1.  Open Windows PowerShell ISE as an administrator.
2.  Open the file **C:\\labfiles\\mod06\\s2s.txt** in Notepad.
3.  Copy the contents into the Windows PowerShell ISE script pane.
4.  Replace the text **&lt;public_root_domain_name&gt;** with the value provided in the lab interface.
5.  Run the script.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have:
>  - Designed your hybrid solution.
>  - Verified prerequisites for the hybrid scenarios that you will enable.
>  - Prepare on-premises and cloud infrastructure for those hybrid scenarios.
