# Lab Answer Key:  Module 6: SharePoint and OneDrive for Business hybrid deployment
# Lab: Implement SharePoint and OneDrive for Business in a hybrid configuration
  
## Exercise 1: Design and prepare SharePoint Server for a hybrid configuration
  
#### Task 1: Design a hybrid solution
  

1. Read the exercise scenario.
2. Using the information provided in the earlier planning topics, answer the following questions:

  - **What hybrid search configuration do you require to support the pilot scenario?**

  You require a cloud hybrid search to support the scenario. Hybrid federated search in SharePoint Online would require a reverse proxy device to enable an inbound connection from SharePoint Online to on-premises SharePoint Server.

  - **What Office 365 or SharePoint Online subscriptions will not support the pilot scenario?**

  The Office 365 Enterprise E1 subscription will not support the pilot scenario. The E1 subscription only supports hybrid federated search in SharePoint Server. It does not support cloud hybrid search, which is required to meet the search requirements.

  - **What SharePoint hybrid feature set supports the pilot scenario?**

  The Hybrid Sites feature set will support the pilot scenario. In addition to hybrid sites, this feature set includes hybrid OneDrive for Business.

  - **What SharePoint Server 2016 version can you use in the pilot scenario?**

  Because the pilot project does not require configuration of hybrid auditing, taxonomy, or content types, you can use the RTM release. Hybrid content types would require the June 2017 Public Update. The other features would require the November 2016 Public Update.

  - **What services do you need to configure in the on-premises SharePoint Server farm, and how can you verify configuration?**

  - The on-premises SharePoint Server farm must have the following services configured:

    - **Managed Metadata**
    - **My Site**
    - **User Profile**

  The simplest way to determine if these services are configured is to open your on-premises SharePoint site with a user account that has not accessed it before, and then select the **My site** link. If the services, including self-service site creation, are properly configured, a new**My Site** will be created. the **My Site** services depend on both**Managed Metadata** and**User Profiles**, so those must be configured correctly for **My Sites** to work.


#### Task 2: Verify prerequisites for hybrid scenario
  
Review the earlier topics, identify the prerequisites for each scenario, and answer the following questions:

- What prerequisites do hybrid sites have? Hybrid sites have only the same basic prerequisites as all hybrid SharePoint features.
- What prerequisites does hybrid OneDrive for Business have? Hybrid OneDrive for Business requires the **User Profile** service. You should also educate your users about the change in experience.
- What prerequisites does hybrid cloud search have? Cloud hybrid search requires the creation of the following accounts: 

  - Search account for cloud hybrid search
  - Managed account for default content access with at least read access

- How can you verify the configuration of Managed Metadata, My Site, and Users Profile services in SharePoint Server? 

  You can verify the configuration of these services by verifying that the My Site service is configured, because it depends on the other two. To do so, perform the following steps: 

  1. On **LON-CL1**, in **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to http://sharepoint.adatum.com.
  2. Sign in with the following credentials:
    - Username: **Beth**
    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
    - Domain: **Adatum**
  3. Select **Sites**.
  4. Sign in with the following credentials:
    - Username: **Beth**
    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
    - Domain: **Adatum**
  5. Select **My Profile**.
  6. Verify that your user profile appears.


#### Task 3: Prepare on-premises and cloud infrastructure for hybrid scenario

11. Select **I accept the terms in the License Agreement** and then select **Install**.
12. Select **Finish** and restart LON-SP1 and sign back in.
13. On the Start menu, right click **Windows PowerShell ISE**, select **more,** and select **Run as Administrator**.
14. Copy the following commands into the script pane and select **Run Script**:

  ```
  Install-Module -Name MSOnline
  Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell
  Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
  Import-Module MSOnline -force
  ```

  > **Note:** If prompted to install a Nu Get package, confirm the installation, including confirming installation from an untrusted source.

15. In the Windows PowerShell ISE command prompt, type **connect-msolservice**, and then press ENTER.
16. Enter the user name **Beth\@adatumyyxxx.onmicrosoft.com** and the password you created in Module 1.
