# Module 2: Deploying and configuring directory synchronization
# Lab: Administering directory synchronization, users, and groups in an Office 365 hybrid environment
  
### Scenario
  Now that the Office 365 tenant is configured and ready for deployment, you are ready to establish directory synchronization and start creating user and group accounts in Office 365 by synchronizing them from your on-premises Active Directory. You and your team should be familiar with how to configure these accounts by using the Microsoft 365 Admin center, because this will be your primary tool for managing the environment after the pilot is fully functional. Additionally, you must ensure that directory synchronization is enabled and that the password policy for Office 365 users matches the password policy for on-premises users. You also want to take advantage of the benefits of Azure AD, such as self-service password reset with writeback functionality.


### Objectives
  After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure Azure AD Connect.
- Manage Office 365 users and groups by using AD DS tools and the Microsoft 365 admin center.
- Manage password policies.

> **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Worldwide Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  Estimated time: 60 minutes

Virtual machines: **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-DS1**, **10984A-LON-WAP1**, and **10984A-LON-CL1**

Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**, **LON-WAP1\Administrator \(only for LON-WAP1\)**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

In all tasks:

- Where you see references to **Adatum*YYXXXX*.onmicrosoft.com**, replace **Adatum*YYXXXX*** with your unique Office 365 name displayed in the online lab portal.
- Where you see references to **Adatum*YYXXXX*.hostdomain.com**, replace **Adatum*YYXXXX***with your unique hostdomain.com name displayed in the online lab portal.

> **Note:** When you connect to the Microsoft 365 admin center, you might be prompted to provide an authentication phone and authentication email address. If you see this window, click **Cancel**.

This lab requires the following virtual machines:

- **LON-DC1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- **LON-DS1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- **LON-WAP1**

  - Sign in as **LON-WAP1\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- **LON-CL1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Beth** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

> **Note:** Please note, at the time of this course's development, Microsoft was rebranding the Office 365 Admin center. In most instances, the Office 365 Admin center now is called the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, you may encounter instances of Office 365 Admin center in this course, particularly in the user interface in labs. Don't assume you're in the wrong portal if you encounter instances of Office 365 Admin center. For this course, the two names refer to the same admin center.


## Exercise 1: Preparing the directory and configuring Azure AD Connect
  
### Scenario
  Before you can configure directory synchronization, the team needs to run several checks, which include looking for duplicate accounts, filtering the directory, and configuring UPNs. When the environment is prepared for directory synchronization, the next step is to install and configure the Azure AD Connect tool and then configure an initial synchronization.


The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Configure UPNs on AD DS accounts
2.  Use the IdFix tool to identify and troubleshoot issues
3.  Download and install Azure AD Connect
4.  Configure directory synchronization with Azure AD Connect
5.  Verify synchronization results


#### Task 1: Configure UPNs on AD DS accounts

1.  On **LON-DC1**, from **Server Manager**, open **Active Directory Domains and Trusts**, and then add **Adatum*yyxxxxx*.hostdomain.com** as an alternate UPN suffix.
2.  Open Windows PowerShell and update the UPN for every user in AD DS with **"\@Adatum*yyxxxxx*.hostdomain.com"** for the domain name. To do this, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties SamAccountName \| foreach {Set-ADUser $\_ -UserPrincipalName \($\_.SamAccountName + "\@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com" \)}
  ```

3.  On **LON-DC1**, set the execution policy in Windows PowerShell to **Unrestricted**, change the path to **C:\\labfiles\\**, and then run the **.\\CreateProblemUsers.ps1** Windows PowerShell script. Before doing that, in File Explorer, navigate to folder C:\\labfiles\\ and change the extension of CreateProblemUsers.txt file to CreateProblemUsers.ps1.

4.  This script will make following changes in AD DS:

  - Klemen Sic. Adds the at sign (\@) to the beginning of **"adatum"** for the **UserPrincipalName** attribute.
  - Lara Raisic. Replaces the existing string with "**lara\@adatum.com**" for the **EmailAddress** attribute.
  - Logan Boyle. Replaces the existing string with **"lara\@adatum.com"** for the **EmailAddress** attribute.
  - Holly Spencer. Replaces the existing string with **"Holly \@adatum.com"** for the **EmailAddress** attribute.
  - Maj Hojski. Replaces the existing string with **" "** for the **emailAddress** attribute.


#### Task 2: Use the IdFix tool to identify and troubleshoot issues

1.  On **LON-CL1**, download the Office 365 IdFix Directory Synchronization Error Remediation Tool from **https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832**.

## Exercise 3: Manage Office 365 password policies and self-service password reset
  
### Scenario
  Your organization has configured a password policy for on-premises users. The password policy requires users to create a complex password and to change their passwords every 60 days, and it prevents users from reusing 15 passwords that they have used before. You need to ensure that the password policy for the pilot users in Office 365 matches the policy for on-premises users and report any settings that cannot be configured to match. Also, you want your users to be able to use self-service password reset from Office 365 and to write back passwords to the on-premises AD DS.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Configure a password policy in Office 365 and enable self-service password reset
2.  Validate the self-service password reset functionality


#### Task 1: Configure a password policy in Office 365 and enable self-service password reset
  
1.  On **LON-CL1**, use the Microsoft 365 admin center to set passwords to expire after 60 days with a notification period of 14 days.
2.  Open the Azure Active Directory admin center and enroll for a trial subscription to Azure AD Premium.
3.  From the Dashboard, run the self-service password reset wizard. Create a group named **SingleSignOn** and add**Abbi Skinner** as a member.


#### Task 2: Validate the self-service password reset functionality
  
1.  Go to **https://myapps.microsoft.com**.
2.  Sign in as **Abbi\@yourdomain.hostdomain.com** with the password**Pa55w.rd**.
3.  Click **verify now** and then set up your mobile phone and email address for verification.
4.  In your profile, set up self- service password reset.
5.  Choose to change the password for Abbi by using the Azure profile UI, and then change the password to **Moc1984A**.
6.  On **LON-DS1**, in Windows PowerShell force directory synchronization by using the **Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta** cmdlet.
7.  Try to sign in to **LON-CL1** as**Adatum\\Abbi** by using the old password of**Pa55w.rd**. Verify that the sign-in attempt fails.
8.  Try to sign in to **LON-CL1** as**Adatum\\Abbi** by using the new password of**Moc10984A**, and verify that it works.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, the students should have successfully configured password policies and self-service password reset.



### Review question(s)
  

**Question** 
When a user resets the password by using the Azure AD profile page, what should you enable to maintain password consistency in Azure AD and AD DS?

**Question** 
If you implement directory synchronization with password synchronization between AD DS and Azure AD, which system authenticates the users when they access services such as Office 365?
