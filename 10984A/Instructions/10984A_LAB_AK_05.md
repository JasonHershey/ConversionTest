## Exercise 2: Design and implement a Skype for Business hybrid configuration
  
#### Task 1: Read and analyze the scenario requirements
  

1.  Read the exercise scenario and analyze the requirements from an integration perspective.
2.  Identify the configurations that are necessary to satisfy the requirements.
3.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as**Adatum\\Beth** with the password**Pa55w.rd**.
4.  Open File Explorer, browse to **C:\\Labfiles\Mod05**, and then open **10984_Lab5_Design.pptx**.
5.  Use the PowerPoint slides to help you document your design.


#### Task 2: Design and discuss a solution with the class
  Use the questions below to help refine your solution.


- **Question 1**: What components do you need to install and configure to satisfy the requirements? **Answer**: You need the following configurations:
    - You must use password synchronization as your password-management solution because it requires the least amount of administrative effort.
- You must deploy an edge server and configure federation and shared namespace.
- You must deploy an HTTP proxy.
- **Question 2**: What are the licensing requirements for Skype for Business Online? **Answer**: You will need either the E5 or E3 license with the add-on for Office 365 Phone System.
- **Question 3**: When moving users to Skype for Business Online, what precautions should Adatum take based on their existing environment? **Answer**: They should not move the Research department as XMPP is not supported in Skype for Business Online. They should enable users for Enterprise Voice before moving them to Skype for Business Online.
- **Question 4**: Which hybrid voice solution will work best for Adatum? **Answer**: They should use Phone System with on-premises PSTN calling by using an existing Skype for Business environment.
- **Question 5**: What would be different if Adatum were running only Lync Server 2010 and not Skype for Business Server 2015 on-premises? **Answer**: You would need to deploy a Skype for Business edge server to support the hybrid voice requirements with an existing Lync Server 2010 environment.
Present your proposed solution to the class. Discuss alternative solutions with the students.
