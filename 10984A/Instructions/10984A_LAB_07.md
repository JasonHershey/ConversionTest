# Module 7: Deploying additional Office 365 services in a hybrid deployment
# Lab: Configure additional Office 365 services in hybrid deployments
  
### Scenario
Adatum Corporation needs to protect identities synchronized to the cloud. Besides protecting user accounts, they also need control over privileged accounts that are being used in the cloud. To achieve that, the project team decided to implement Multi-Factor Authentication, Azure AD Identity Protection, and Azure AD Privileged Identity Management in a pilot environment.



### Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication.
- Implement Azure Information Protection.
- Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

> **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Office 365. Microsoft Worldwide Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  Estimated time: 75 minutes


Virtual machines: **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-DS1**, **10984A-LON-CL1**, and **10984A-LON-CL2**
Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

In all tasks:
- Where you see references to *AdatumYYXXXX***.onmicrosoft.com**, replace *AdatumYYXXXX* with your unique Office 365 name displayed in the online lab portal.
- Where you see references to *AdatumYYXXXX***.hostdomain.com**, replace the *AdatumYYXXXX* with your unique hostdomain.com name displayed in the online lab portal.

> **Note:** Please note, at the time of this course's development, Microsoft was rebranding the Office 365 Admin center. In most instances, the Office 365 Admin center now is called the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, you may encounter instances of Office 365 Admin center in this course, particularly in the user interface in labs. Don't assume you're in the wrong portal if you encounter instances of Office 365 Admin center. For this course, the two names refer to the same admin center.

> **Note:** When you connect to the Office 365 Admin center, you might be prompted to provide an authentication phone and authentication email address. If you see this window, select **Cancel**.

This lab requires the following virtual machines:

- **LON-DC1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- **LON-DS1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- **LON-CL1**

  - Sign in as **Adatum\\Abbi** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
