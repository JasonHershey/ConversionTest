# Module 5: Skype for Business hybrid deployment
# Lab: Implement the Skype for Business hybrid configuration
  
### Scenario
Adatum is continuing with their strategy to implement a hybrid Office 365 solution. You now need to implement Skype for Business Online in a hybrid configuration and evaluate Teams.

### Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Design and implement a Skype for Business hybrid environment.
- Move users to Skype for Business Online and verify functionality.

> **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365, and Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently. Therefore, they aren't available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
Estimated time: 120 minutes

Virtual machines: **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-DS1**, **10984A-LON-EX1**, **10984A-LON-SFB**, **10984A-LON-EDGE**, **10984A-LON-CL1**, and **10984A-LON-CL2**

Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

Virtual machine: **10984A-LON-WAP1**

Username: **LON-WAP1\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

This lab requires the completion of all prior labs (Lab 1 - Lab 4) before you begin. If the virtual machines are not running, you must complete the following step:

- Sign in to the virtual machines **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-DS1**, **10984A-LON-EX1**, **10984A-LON-WAP1**, **10984A-LON-SFB**, **10984A-LON-EDGE**, **10984A-LON-CL1**, and **10984A-LON-CL2** by using the following credentials.

  - Username: **Administrator**
  - Password: **Pa55w.rd**.

On **10984A-LON-SFB** and **10984A-LON-EDGE**, verify that the Skype for Business Server 2015 ISO image is mounted as drive **D**.

> **Note:** Please note, at the time of this course's development, Microsoft was rebranding the Office 365 Admin center. In most instances, the Office 365 Admin center now is called the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, you may encounter instances of Office 365 Admin center in this course, particularly in the user interface in labs. Don't assume you're in the wrong portal if you encounter instances of Office 365 Admin center. For this course, the two names refer to the same admin center.


## Exercise 1: Deploy Skype for Business with Enterprise Voice (pre-lab)
  
### Scenario
To prepare for Module 5, Lab A, Skype for Business Server 2015 will be deployed by using the custom domain provided to you (for example, Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com). Most of the preparation will be automated. You will need to run a series of scripts and provide information when prompted.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Prepare the environment (these steps have already been done for you)
2. Define topology (these steps have already been done for you)
3. Update the topology
4. Run deployment scripts


#### Task 1: Prepare the environment (these steps have already been done for you)

> **Note:** To save time, the steps in Task 1 and Task 2 have been completed for you. They are provided here for your information and future reference. You can proceed directly to **Task 3: Update Topology** to start this lab.


#### Task 2: Define topology (these steps have already been done for you)

> **Note:** To save time, the steps in Task 1 and Task 2 have been completed for you. They are provided here for your information and future reference. You can proceed directly to **Task 3: Update Topology** to start this lab.


#### Task 3: Update the topology

## Exercise 2: Design and implement a Skype for Business hybrid configuration
  
### Scenario
Adatum currently has the following Exchange Server servers deployed:

Atlanta site (6,000 users):

- **atl-pool.adatum.com**
- **ATL-FE1** (Skype for Business Front End - Enterprise Edition)
- **ATL-FE2** (Skype for Business Front End - Enterprise Edition)
- **ATL-FE3** (Skype for Business Front End - Enterprise Edition)
- **ATL-BE1** (SQL Server 2016)

London site (1,500 users):

- **LON-SE1** (Standard Edition Server)
- **LON-SE2** (Standard Edition Server)

**Additionally, the following information is available:**

- The London site and Atlanta site are both connected to the internet.
- Network load balancers are used to distribute connections to the three servers in the atl-pool.adatum.com Front End pool.
- **Lyncdiscoverinternal** resolves to atl-pool.adatum.com.
- You have an Office 365 Enterprise E3 trial subscription for 25 pilot users.
- Your manager asks you to evaluate both Skype for Business Online and Teams.
- Mailbox migration is 50 percent complete. Approximately half of the users from each site still have mailboxes on-premises.
- Azure AD Connect was deployed to support the Exchange hybrid configuration.
- Enterprise Voice has been deployed, but only the users in London are enabled for it. The London IP-PBX is already integrated with Enterprise Voice and users can make and receive phone calls by using their Skype for Business clients.
- Users in Atlanta use a legacy TDM-PBX and proprietary phones for PSTN connectivity. Atlanta users cannot use their Skype for Business clients to make calls to the PSTN.

**You have the following requirements:**

- Atlanta users must be able to make phone calls to any outside phone number by using their Skype for Business client.
- Users in the Research department in Atlanta must be able to communicate with a line of business applications that use XMPP for instant messaging and presence.
- The pilot users for Teams must be able to place calls through their on-premises IP-PBX.
- The world-wide sales organization for Adatum wants to leverage call queues. All sales representatives must be agents in at least one call queue.
- If the Atlanta site goes down, Atlanta users must be able to continue to communicate by using their Skype for Business clients.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Read and analyze the scenario requirements
2. Design and discuss a solution with the class
3. Configure Enterprise Voice
4. Deploy a Skype for Business hybrid configuration

5. Use the PowerPoint slides to help you document your design.


#### Task 2: Design and discuss a solution with the class
Use the questions below to help refine your solution.

- **Question 1**: What components do you need to install and configure to satisfy the requirements?
- **Question 2**: What are the licensing requirements for Skype for Business Online?
- **Question 3**: When moving users to Skype for Business Online, what precautions should Adatum take based on their existing environment?
- **Question 4**: Which hybrid voice solution will work best for Adatum?
