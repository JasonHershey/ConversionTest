# Module 3: Exchange Server hybrid deployment planning
# Lab: Planning and designing the integration between Exchange Online and Exchange Server 2016
  
### Scenario
  You are the Exchange administrator for a company called Adatum. Your company has run Exchange Server on-premises as their corporate messaging and collaboration system for more than10 years. Adatum currently runs a mix of Exchange Server 2010 and Exchange Server 2013 that support 7,000 user mailboxes. Adatum needs to upgrade the current environment to Exchange 2016. As part of upgrade, you will start to transition some mailboxes to Office 365. Azure AD Connect has been deployed and directory synchronization is enabled and working between your local AD and Azure AD. You must implement Exchange Online in a hybrid configuration based on your organizational requirements. Before the deployment, you need to design Adatum's hybrid configuration and plan for the hybrid deployment.


### Objectives
  After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Design an Exchange hybrid solution.
- Propose a hybrid solution for a given scenario.

> **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365, and Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently. Therefore, they aren't available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  Estimated time: 40 minutes

Virtual machines: **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-DS1**, **10984A-LON-EX1**, **10984A-LON-WAP1**, **10984A-LON-CL1**, and **10984A-LON-EDGE**

For **10984A-LON-DC1, 10984A-LON-DS1, 10984A-LON-EX1, 10984A-LON-EDGE**, and **10984A-LON-CL1** sign in by using the following credentials:

Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For **10984A-LON-WAP1** sign in by using the following credentials:

Username: **LON-WAP1\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you need to use the available virtual machine environment. This lab depends on the completion of Module 1 Lab A and Module 2 Lab A. If the lab machines are not running, before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:


- For **10984A-LON-DC1**, **10984A-LON-DS1**, **10984A-LON-EX1,** and**10984A-LON-CL1**, and **10984A-LON-EDGE**, sign in by using the following credentials:

  - Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**
  - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

- For **10984A-LON-WAP1** sign in by using the following credentials:

  - Username: **LON-WAP1\Administrator**
  - Password: **Pa55w.rd**


## Exercise 1: Designing an Exchange hybrid deployment
  
### Scenario
  Adatum currently has the following Exchange Server servers deployed:

New York site (2500 users):

- **NY-DAG1**
- **NYC-EX1** (Exchange Server 2013 - Mailbox &amp; CAS roles)
- **NYC-EX2** (Exchange Server 2013 - Mailbox &amp; CAS roles)

Atlanta site (3000 users):

- **ATL-EX1** (Exchange 2010 - Client Access role)
- **ATL-EX2** (Exchange 2010 - Mailbox role)
- **ATL-EX3** (Exchange 2010 - Hub Transport role)

London site (1500 users):

- **LON-DAG1**
- **LON-EX1** (Exchange Server 2013 - Mailbox &amp; CAS roles)
- **LON-EX2** (Exchange Server 2013 - Mailbox &amp; CAS roles)

Additionally, the following information is available:

- The London site, New York site, and Atlanta site are all connected to the internet.
- In the event of an internet outage, the New York and Atlanta sites can route internet traffic across a dedicated wide area network (WAN) connection between the two sites.
- Layer 7 Network Load Balancers are used to distribute connections to the **LON-DAG1** servers and the**NY-DAG1** servers. They can also function as reverse proxies.
- AutoDiscover from the internet is currently not configured and not functional.
- The Exchange Server organization has a non-Microsoft email relay to send and receive messages to and from the internet. This solution is required to meet strict industry regulations on electronic communications.
- You have an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription to a test implementation of Exchange Online.
- Your manager asks you not only to evaluate Exchange Online on its own, but also to connect the existing Exchange Server organization with Exchange Online.
- The Exchange Servers in Atlanta will be upgraded to Exchange Server 2016 in 30 days.

You have the following requirements:

- Free/busy information and MailTips must be available on both sides.
- Executives need to delegate mailbox permissions to their administrative assistants.
- Mailbox moves must occur in the Exchange admin center or in Windows PowerShell.
- All new and existing user mailboxes must be managed from Adatum's internal AD DS domain, adatum.com.
- 50% of all mailboxes must be moved to Exchange Online within six months.
- Users must be required to sign in only once when they start their computer.
- The on-premises Exchange Servers must not be able to send/receive email directly to/from the internet.
- The password-management solution should require the least amount of administrative effort to implement and support.
- The solution must enable Adatum to move some mailboxes to Exchange Online while still allowing users to use their domain accounts for at least 12 months.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Read and analyze the scenario requirements
2.  Design a solution


#### Task 1: Read and analyze the scenario requirements
  
- Read the exercise scenario. Analyze the requirements from an integration perspective. Identify the configurations that are necessary to satisfy the requirements.


#### Task 2: Design a solution
  
- **Question**: What components do you need to install and configure to satisfy the requirements?
- **Question**: What are the licensing requirements for Exchange Online?
- **Question**: What existing Exchange Servers can you use for Hybrid transport and Autodiscover?
- **Question**: What other areas do you need to consider if you want to run the Hybrid Configuration wizard successfully?
- **Question**: What would be different if Adatum were running only Exchange Server 2010 and not Exchange Server 2013 on-premises?
- **Question**: What Hybrid Transport option should you implement?

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully read and analyzed the scenario requirements and designed a solution.


## Exercise 2: Discussing a solution and reviewing the Exchange Online setup
  
### Scenario
  Before deploying Exchange hybrid, you want to review current Exchange Online setup.


The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:


1.  Discuss your solution with the class
2.  Reviewing an Exchange Online configuration in an Office 365 tenant
3.  Prepare the Exchange on-premises environment
4.  Prepare for the next module
