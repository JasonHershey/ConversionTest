# Lab: Implement the Exchange Server hybrid deployment
  
## Exercise 1: Using the Hybrid Configuration Wizard
  
#### Task 1: Verify public accessibility
  

1. On **LON-WAP1**, already signed in as **LON-WAP1\Administrator**, open Internet Explorer, navigate to **bing.com**, type **What is My IP** in the **Search** box, and then press Enter.
2. If an Internet Explorer dialog box open, Click **Yes**.
3. Document the public IP address displayed for the **LON-WAP1** server. You will need this IP address later.
4. Close the **Internet Explorer** window.
5. On **LON-CL1**, sign in as **Adatum\\Beth** with the password **Pa55w.rd**, from the taskbar, open Microsoft Edge, and then navigate to [https://aka.ms/AA2p30o](https://aka.ms/AA2p30o).
6. In the **Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer** window, select the **Exchange server** tab, and then in the **Microsoft Exchange Web Services Connectivity Tests** section, select **Synchronization, Notification, Availability, and Automatic Replies**. Select **Next**.
7. In the **Synchronization, Notification, Availability, and Automatic Replies** window, specify the following:

  - Email address: **abbi\@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Domain\\User Name \(or UPN\): **abbi\@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Password: **Moc10984A**
  - Confirm Password: **Moc10984A**
  - Select the **I understand that I must use the credentials of a working account from my Exchange domain to be able to test connectivity to it remotely. I also acknowledge that I am responsible for the management and security of this account** check box.

8. Type the verification characters, select **Verify**, and then select **Perform Test**.

  > **Note:** You should receive a "Connectivity Test Successful with Warnings" message. This indicates that on-premises Exchange Web Services is accessible.
  > If you do receive an error, verify that DNS records were created on LON-DC1 using your assigned custom domain name

9. Select **Start Over** to go back to the **Exchange Server** tab.
10. In the **Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests** section, select **Outlook Autodiscover**, and then select **Next**.
11. In the **Outlook Autodiscover** window, specify the following:

  - Email address: **abbi\@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Domain\\User Name \(or UPN\): **abbi\@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Password: **Moc10984A**
  - Confirm Password: **Moc10984A**
  - Select the **I understand that I must use the credentials of a working account from my Exchange domain to be able to test connectivity to it remotely. I also acknowledge that I am responsible for the management and security of this account** check box.

12. If necessary, type the verification characters, select **Verify**, and then select **Perform Test**.
13. In the **Test Details** section, select **Expand All**, locate the **Attempting to resolve the host name adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com in DNS** test step, and then compare the IP addresses returned in this test step to the one you documented in step 2. If it matches one of the addresses, you have connected to your on-premises server by using Outlook Anywhere.

  > **Note:** You should receive a "Connectivity Test Successful with Warnings" message.
  > Selecting the **Ignore Trust for SSL** check box would allow this test to succeed even if your certificate is not trusted.

14. To return to the **Exchange Server** tab, select **Start Over**.
15. In the **Internet E-Mail Tests** section, select **Inbound SMTP E-Mail**, and then select **Next**.
16. In the **Inbound SMTP E-Mail** window, type the following email address: **abbi\@adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**.
17. If necessary, type the verification characters, and then select **Verify**. Select **Perform Test**.

  > **Note:** You should receive a "Connectivity Test Successful" message.
  > Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\) uses opportunistic Transport Layer Security (TLS) by default. Even if the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer does not trust the certificate, the test message will succeed.

18. In the **Test Details** window, select **Expand All**, scroll to the last test performed, and then verify that the following message appears: "The Open Relay test passed. This MX isn't an open relay." 
19. Exit the Remote Connectivity Analyzer by closing Microsoft Edge.
20. On **LON-EX1**, already signed in as **Adatum\\Administrator**, from the taskbar, open the Exchange Management Shell.
21. In the **Exchange Management Shell** window, run the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-ExchangeCertificate | Where-Object {$_.Subject -match "^CN=\\*"} | Format-List
  ```

22. In the **Exchange Management Shell** window, confirm the certificate that on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server uses by reviewing the results for the following attributes:

  - IsSelfSigned: **False**
  - NotAfter: _date not expired_
  - Status: **Valid**
  - Services: **SMTP**

  > **Note:** It is a good idea to document the thumbprint for the certificate that Exchange Server used. Event logs typically reference a certificate thumbprint, rather than the subject or friendly name, in warnings and error messages. This is also helpful when multiple certificates with the same subject name exist.
  > In your production environments, you also want to make sure that **Issuer** is trusted third party public certificate authority so Microsoft Exchange Online can trust the certificate.

23. Leave the **Exchange Management Shell** window open.


#### Task 2: Use the Exchange admin center to verify on-premises deployment
  

1. On **LON-CL1**, already signed in as **Adatum\\Beth**, open Microsoft Edge, and then navigate to **https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home**. Sign in as **beth\@adatumyyxxxx.onmicrosoft.com** with the password you created in the lab in Module 1, "Introduction to Office 365 administration and licensing. "
