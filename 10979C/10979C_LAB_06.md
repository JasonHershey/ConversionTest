# Module 6: Cloud storage
# Lab: Configure Azure Storage
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum has an archive of media files stored on your on-premises file servers. You want to perform a test transfer of these files to Azure Blob storage.


### Objectives
  
After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create an Azure Storage account and a blob container.
-   Upload a blob to the storage account container.
>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab Setup
  
Estimated Time: 20 minutes

Virtual machine:  **10979C-MIA-CL1**

User name:  **Admin**

Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

For this lab, you need to use the available VM environment. Before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:

1.   On the host computer, start  **Hyper-V Manager**.
2.   In Hyper-V Manager, click  **10979C-MIA-CL1**, and then in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.
3.   In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the VM starts. 
4.   Sign in by using the following credentials: 

  -   User name:  **Admin**
  -   Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

5.   You also need to start  **MSL-TMG1** for Internet access.


## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Storage account
  
### Scenario
  
Before you start managing your data in Azure, you should first create a storage account, examine the account's properties, and copy its access key to a text file.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create a storage account in Azure
2.   View the properties of your storage account and copy the access key


#### Task 1: Create a storage account in Azure
  
1.   From MIA-CL1, launch Microsoft Internet Explorer and browse to 
        [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
      .
2.   If prompted to authenticate, sign in by using either the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator Microsoft account from your Microsoft Azure subscription.
3.   From Azure Portal, create a new storage account with the following settings: 

  -   Name: Any valid, unique name (between 3 and 24 characters consisting of lowercase letters and digits)
  -   Deployment model:  **Resource** **Manager**
  -   Account kind:  **General purpose**
  -   Performance:  **Standard**
  -   Replication:  **Locally-redundant storage**
  -   Subscription:  **Your subscription**
  -   Resource group:  **Create new**
  -   New resource group name:  **StorageLabRG**
  -   Location: The Azure region closest to your classroom location.
  -   Pin to dashboard: Selected

4.   Wait for the storage account to be provisioned. This will take about a minute. When the deployment completes, the portal will display the storage account with its  **Settings** blade open.


#### Task 2: View the properties of your storage account and copy the access key
  
1.   In Azure Portal, with your storage account open, review the  **Essentials** section, including the location, replication, and performance settings.
2.   Display the  **Access keys** blade.  In the  **Access keys** blade, notice that you have the option of copying the values of storage account names including key1 and key2. You also have the ability to regenerate both keys.
3.   In the  **Access key** blade, copy the access key of key1 to clipboard.
4.   On MIA-CL1, launch File Explorer.
5.   From File Explorer, create a new text document in the  **Documents** folder named **storage-key.txt**.
6.   Paste the access key that you copied to clipboard into the file and save the file. Keep Notepad open. You will need it for the next exercise.
7.   Display the  **Configuration** blade.
8.   In the  **Configuration** blade, notice that you have the option of changing the replication settings. However, you cannot change the performance setting (this can only be assigned when the storage account is created).
9.   Close the  **Settings** blade but leave the storage account pane open.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have created your Azure Storage, examined its properties, and copied its access key to a text file.


## Exercise 2: Create and manage blobs
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you have created your storage account, you need to create a container and upload data to the container.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create a container
2.   Add data to the container by using Azure Web Storage Explorer
3.   Prepare for the next module


#### Task 1: Create a container
  
-   From the storage account blade, create a new blob container with the following settings:

  -   Name:  **labcontainer**
  -   Access type:  **Blob**


#### Task 2: Add data to the container by using Azure Web Storage Explorer
  
1.   Switch to the page of Notepad showing the content of the  **storage-key.txt** file and copy the storage account access key into the clipboard (in case you overwrote it in the meantime).
2.   Open a new Internet Explorer window and browse to  **http://azurestorage.azurewebsites.net/login.aspx**
3.   On the  **Azure Web Storage Explorer** page, in **Account**, type the name that you assigned to your storage account at the beginning of this lab, paste the access key that you copied into the clipboard into the  **Key** box, and then press Enter.
4.   On the  **Azure Web Storage Explorer** page, upload **splashscreen.contrast-white_scale-400.png** from the **C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel\images** folder on MIA-CL1 to the **labcontainer** container in your storage account.
5.   In the file list, right-click  **https://** ** _yourstorageaccountname_.blob.core.windows.net/labcontainer/ splashscreen.contrast-white_scale-400.png** and click **Open in new window** from the right-click menu.
6.   Verify that you see a gear wheel in the new Internet Explorer window. 
7.   Close all Internet Explorer windows.


#### Task 3: Prepare for the next module
  
When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the virtual machines. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have created a blob container and uploaded the data.



**Question** 
Can you convert a Standard storage account into a Premium Storage account?

**Question** 
Is it possible to upload a file to an Azure Storage blob by using Azure Portal?
