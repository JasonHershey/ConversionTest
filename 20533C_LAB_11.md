# Module 11: Implementing Azure-based management and automation
# Lab: Implementing Automation
  
### Scenario
  
 A. Datum Corporation wishes to minimize administrative overhead as much as possible, especially for tasks such as deploying and deprovisioning VMs. For this reason, as part of A. Datum's evaluation of Microsoft Azure, you have been asked to test the new Azure Automation features and, as part of your tests, to deploy Azure VMs by using runbook automation.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure Automation accounts.

- Create runbooks.


### Lab Setup
  
 Estimated Time: 40 minutes

Virtual Machine:  **20533C-MIA-CL1**

 User Name:  **Student**

 Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

 Before starting this lab, ensure that you have performed the "Preparing the Azure environment" demonstration tasks at the beginning of the first lesson in this module, and that the setup script has completed.


## Exercise 1: Configuring Automation accounts
  
### Scenario
  
 Administrators at A. Datum Corporation spend considerable time creating storage accounts and Azure VMs. You want to increase administrator productivity by using Automation to execute these tasks and freeing administrators to continue with other tasks.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Automation account

2. Create an Azure AD user 

3. Create Automation assets



#### Task 1: Create an Automation account
  
1. Ensure that you are signed in to MIA-CL1 as  **Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**, and that the setup script you ran in the previous demonstration to prepare the environment has completed.

2. Sign in to the Azure portal by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.

3. Create a new Azure Automation account with the following settings:


  - Name:  **LabAutomationAccount**

  - Resource group: create a new resource group named  **AutomationLabRG**

  - Subscription: your current subscription

  - Region: an Azure region that you chose when running the provisioning script

  - Account Options: leave at the default setting. This will create a tutorial runbook in the new account

  - Pin to dashboard: Leave enabled


1. Wait for the Automation account to be provisioned. This should take less than a minute.



#### Task 2: Create an Azure AD user
  
1. From the Azure classic portal, create a new user in the default directory of your Azure subscription, with the following settings:


  - USER NAME:  **LabAutomationUser**

  - @: leave the default value

  - ROLE:  **user**

  - Multi Factor Authentication: disabled

  - DISPLAY NAME:  **Lab Automation User**


1. From the Azure classic portal, configure the new user as a Co-Administrator of the current subscription.

2. Change the temporary password of the newly created user to  **Pa$$w0rd**.



#### Task 3: Create Automation assets
  
1. In the Azure portal, in the  **Automation Account** blade, add a Credential asset:


  - Name:  **PSCredential**

  - Description:  **Lab Automation User (Co-Administrator)**

  - User name: the name of the newly created AutomationUser account that you copied to Notepad

  - Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

  - Confirm password:  **Pa$$w0rd**


1. In the same Automation account, create the following Automation unencrypted Variable assets of the String type:


  - SubscriptionName: name of your subscription

  - AdminName:  **Student**

  - AdminPassword:  **Pa$$w0rd**

  - Location:  _the name of Azure_ _region_ _that_ _you used when running the provisioning script at the beginning of this module_

  - Network:  **ADATUM-HQ-VNET**

  - Subnet:  **Subnet-1**


1. In the same Automation account, create the following Schedule asset:


  - Name:  **EndOfDay**

  - Description:  **End of Day**

  - Starts: tomorrow's date at  **18:00:00**

  - Recurrence: Daily

  - Runs every (number of days):  **1**

  - Set expiration: clear this check box

  - Expires:  **Never**


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured a new Microsoft Azure Automation account, and created a new Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organizational account to use as an Automation Credential asset.


## Exercise 2: Creating runbooks
  
### Scenario
  
 As part of your tests of the new Azure Automation features, you will now deploy Azure virtual machines by using an Automation runbook.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Import a runbook

2. Publish and execute a runbook

3. Reset the environment



#### Task 1: Import a runbook
  
1. From the Azure portal, import the PowerShell workflow script  **New-StorageVNetAndVMs.ps1** residing in the D:\Labfiles\Lab11\Solution folder into your Automation account.

2. Review the content of the runbook.



#### Task 2: Publish and execute a runbook
  
1. Publish the  **New-StorageAndVMs** runbook.

2. Start the newly published runbook.

3. View the progress of the runbook execution. Wait until the job completes.



#### Task 3: Reset the environment
  
1. Launch Windows PowerShell as  **Administrator**.

2. From the Windows PowerShell prompt, run:

  ```
  Reset-Azure
  ```

3. When prompted (twice), sign in by using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. 

4. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want to target with the script.

5. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script will remove Azure services in your subscription. We therefore recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Microsoft Azure environment to be ready for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage, VMs, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important**: The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it (if this occurs, you will see an error). If you find remaining objects after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the  **Reset-Azure** script, or use the Azure portal and Azure classic portal to delete all the objects in your Azure subscription manually â€”with the exception of the default director.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have imported, published, and executed a PowerShell workflow-based runbook that deploys two virtual machines in parallel.



**Question** 
Why did you have to create an Azure AD account in the lab?

**Question** 
What should you consider when testing the execution of an Automation runbook?
