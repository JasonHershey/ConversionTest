# Lab: Implementing PaaS cloud services
  
## Exercise 1: Deploying a PaaS cloud service
  
#### Task 1: Create a linked resource for a PaaS cloud service
  
1. Ensure that the MIA-CL1 lab virtual machine is running, and then sign in as  **Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.

2. Start Windows PowerShell as an Administrator.

3. Type the following command, and then press Enter.

  ```
  Add-AzureAccount
  ```

4. Sign in with the user credentials associated with your Azure account.

5. Type the following command, and then press Enter.

  ```
  Get-AzureLocation | Select-Object Name
  ```

6. From the list of Azure regions, identify the one closest to your location, and then note the region's name.

7. Type the following command, and then press Enter.

  ```
  New-AzureSqlDatabaseServer -AdministratorLogin 'yourname' -AdministratorLoginPassword 'Pa$$w0rd' -Location 'YourRegion'
  ```

Replace  _yourname_ with your first name and _Your Region_ with the Azure region you noted in step 6.

8. Type the following command, and then press Enter.

  ```
  Get-AzureSqlDatabaseServer
  ```

9. Note the server name of the Azure SQL Database server you created in step 7.

10. Launch Windows Internet Explorer, navigate to https://portal.azure.com, and then sign in with the service administrator account of your Azure subscription.

11. In the left navigation bar, click  **Browse**, and then in the blade that is being displayed, click  **SQL databases**.

12. In the SQL Database blade, click  **Add**.

13. In the  **Database name** box, type **CloudServiceProdDB**.

14. Ensure that the name of the server you created in step 7 appears in the  **Server** entry.

15. In the SQL Database blade, click  **Create**.

16. Switch to Windows PowerShell, type the following command, and then press Enter.


```
New-AzureStorageAccount -StorageAccountName 'cloudappprodxxx' -Location 'Your Region'
```


 Replace  _xxx_ with a unique sequence of characters (digits or lowercase letters), and replace _Your region_ with the Azure region you noted in step 6. If the cmdlet fails because the storage account name you chose is already in use, try a different one.

 To test if the storage account name is already in use, type the following command, and then pressing Enter.



```
Test-AzureName -Storage 'cloudappprodxxx'
```


 Replace  _xxx_ with a unique sequence of characters (digits or lowercase letters). An output of **False** indicates that the name has not been assigned yet and is available for you to use.

5. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want the script to target.

6. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script removes Azure services from your subscription. It is therefore recommended that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course and not your own Azure account.
> The script takes 5-10 minutes to reset your Microsoft Azure environment so that it is ready for the next lab. The script removes all storage, virtual machines, virtual networks (VNETs), cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important**: The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it. (If this occurs, you will see an error.) If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the  **Reset-Azure** script or use the Azure portal and the Azure classic portal to manually delete all the objects in your Azure subscriptionâ€”with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you will have configured monitoring for a PaaS cloud service with new metrics and an alert.
